Now that your app is uploaded the last step is choosing the build you want to use for your app and submitting it for review in iTunes Connect.

#Select a build

For this step go back to [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/) and open your app. Then go to the *Prerelease* tab, here you will see a list of builds. If you have just uploaded your build from Xcode it is very likely that it is still *processing*:

If that is the case you will have to wait a couple of minutes before you can continue. Once processing is completed, the *Prerelease* overview should look like this:

This means your build is processed completely. Once that is the case you can go back to the main page of your App and select the uploaded build in the builds section:

After hitting the *+* button you should see this popup that includes your recently uploaded build:

#Submit for Review

Now you can hit **Submit for Review** again. If everything is set up correctly your app will go into Apple's review queue. Congratulations! In a couple of days your App should get approved and be available on the App Store!

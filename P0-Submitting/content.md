Once you have finished developing your game you will face the most exciting step - publishing it on the Apple App Store and making it available for the whole world to play!

Throughout the next pages we will guide you through the process of submitting your game - step by step.

##Create an Apple Developer Account

First of all, you will need to create an Apple Developer Account to publish your game. Apple charges 99$ a year for this account. You can register as a developer on [Apple's Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/register/index.action). If you already have an Apple ID you can sign in with that and purchase the Developer Account. If you don't have an Apple ID yet, you will have to create that first (there's a link on the page that brings you to the signup page).

Once you are successfully enrolled in Apple's developer program, you can move on to the next step!
